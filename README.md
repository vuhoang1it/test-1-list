# List

Create a list application from the provided design file [list.xd](list.xd) (can
be opened in [Adobe XD](https://www.adobe.com/products/xd.html)) or available
[here](https://xd.adobe.com/view/3859fb2f-c300-4d3e-8e50-23a085a7ad2c-6d0a/specs/).

## Project setup

- Fork this repository.
- Install dependencies.
- Start dev server.

```bash
# install
npm ci
# serve with hot-reload for development
npm run serve
```

Tips for VSCode extensions.

- [ESLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint)
  for common mistakes
- [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode)
  for code formatting
- [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=johnsoncodehk.volar)
  for vue support

## Libraries

The following libraries are available, you can import any utility you'll need.

- [date-fns](https://date-fns.org/) `import { } from "date-fns"` (date
  formatting)
- [lodash](https://lodash.com/) `import { } from "lodash"` (utility)

## Requirements

- This project should use [typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and
  [vue](https://vuejs.org/) (vue components should also use typescript).
- Vue components should use composition api with `setup() { ... }`
  - **Bonus points** when `<script lang="ts" setup>` is used.
  - The `<style>` blocks should use scss modules `<style lang="scss" module>`
- All scss colors should be defined in `sass/_color.scss` file.
  - This can be then used via `@use "sass/color"` in component style blocks.
- Search bar, list item and icons (svg files in assets) should be individual vue
  components.
  - **Tip:** Create icon components simply by copying the svg code to component
    `<template>`

### Search Bar

- Should be a vue component.
- The search bar should use `v-model` for its value, for example
  `<SearchBar v-model="searchQuery" />`
- Non-empty value can be cleared through the clear button, or by pressing Escape
  key.
- If the search bar is empty, the clear and add buttons should be hidden.
- Typing in search bar should filter the displayed list by its value (case
  insensitive), including partial matches.
- If searched string (case insensitive) is already present in the list, the add
  button should be disabled and appropriate item should be marked as "Exact
  match".
- If no exact match is found, the add button should be enabled and click on it
  (or by pressing Enter key) should add the string value to the list.

### List

- List data should be stored in
  [localStorage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage)
  in such way, that data in list will be preserved on page refresh.
- Each item in list should keep track of when that item was added to the list.
- Each item should also track in what order it was added in the following way:
  - Starting from #1
  - New item # should be equal to maximum number in list + 1
  - Deleting an item from list will not recalculate # of the remaining items
- **Tip:** There should be a data source _ref_ that is sorted/filtered using
  _computed_.

### List Item

- Should be a vue component.
- Should display delete button on mouse over.
- Should display the added date in human readable format (use date-fns)
- **Bonus points** if the displayed time is updated in realtime.

### Sorting

- List should be sortable by either string value (from a to z) or by added date
  (newest date first).
- Simple click on the _Sort by Value_ or _Sort by Added Date_ buttons should
  sort the list immediately.
- **Bonus points** if the selected sort method is preserved on page refresh.
